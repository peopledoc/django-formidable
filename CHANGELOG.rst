ChangeLog
=========

Release 2.1.1 (2018-06-22)
==========================

- Moved the injection of the JSON ``version`` into the serializer, rather than the ``Formidable.to_json()`` class method. The serializer is called by the method, so it's idempotent (#340).

Release 2.1.0 (2018-06-21)
==========================

- Added the JSON ``version`` when going through the ``Formidable.to_json()`` class method. This would ensure that stored schemas would carry their version and wouldn't need extra JSON schema migrations (#337).

Release 2.0.0 (2018-05-30)
==========================

- Deprecate support for Django 1.8 and Django 1.9 (#325).
- Drop crowdin for translation handling (#333).

Release 1.7.0 (2018-04-20)
==========================

**Deprecation Warning**: Support for django<=1.9 will be dropped by the version 2.0.0.

- Added a tool to build the JSON Schema from the ``formidable.yml`` file, and include it into the documentation.
- Add a deprecation warning for django 1.8 and 1.9 (#325).

Release 1.6.0 (2018-04-06)
==========================

- Added compatibility with Python 3.6 (#318).
- Allow change type for the fields without changing name/slug

Release 1.5.2 (2018-03-30)
==========================

- Allow null and empty condition names.
- Added compatibility tests using Django 1.11.

Release 1.5.1 (2018-03-28)
==========================

- Make sure that the `ValidateView.form_valid` method return an actual empty body content along with a 204 HTTP status response. Before this hotfix, the dictionary passed along as the response content was serialized into a 2-character string to calculate the content-length, but this content was not returned to the client. Some browsers would experience it badly, namely IE11 (#313).

Release 1.5.0 (2018-03-09)
==========================

- Trim whitespaces in the generated ``formidable.js`` file. This is more than just cosmetics, it prevents to have a polluted history on this file (#306).
- Added tests to use conditional rules with drop down lists (#304)
- Added possibility to restrict types of the conditional rules (#304)
- Hotfix: Extract conditions and filter them using the fields that exist in the form (#308).
- Added typing to the demo requirements (#311)
- Make the conditional rule name optional (#307)

Release 1.4.1 (2018-03-06)
==========================

- Added Hotfix from #308: Extract conditions and filter them using the fields that exist in the form.

Release 1.4.0 (2018-02-21)
==========================

**Deprecation Warning**: The validation endpoint (using the URL ``forms/(?P<pk>\d+)/validate/``) is now ``POST`` only.

- Added tests against the ``formidable.yml`` schema definition of Forms (#295).
- Fixed various items in the schema definition (#297).
- Validation endpoint for **user data** doesn't allow GET method anymore (#300).
- Add support for multiple conditions to target a common field.

Release 1.3.1 (2018-03-06)
==========================

- Added Hotfix from #308: Extract conditions and filter them using the fields that exist in the form.

Release 1.3.0 (2018-02-14)
==========================

**Deprecation Warning**: The validation endpoint (using the URL ``forms/(?P<pk>\d+)/validate/``) was only accessible via the ``GET`` verb. It may have caused issues if we tried to validate very long forms, or forms with very large values, by hitting the querystring size limit. As a consequence, as of 1.3.0, the ``GET`` method is deprecated in favor of the ``POST`` method.

- Allow POST method for form validation endpoint.
- [Documentation] Fixed a missing ``cd`` in docs. You can't run pytest from project root (#293).
- includes 7 more languages (not translated yet): Czech, Danish, Finnish, Canadian French, Hungarian, Japanese, Swedish.

Release 1.2.2 (2018-03-06)
==========================

- Added Hotfix from #308: Extract conditions and filter them using the fields that exist in the form.

Release 1.2.1 (2018-01-12)
==========================

- Keep only existing fields ids for current role in the conditional part

Release 1.2.0 (2018-01-09)
==========================

- Allow wrong field ids in conditions

Release 1.1.0 (2017-12-04)

- Add JSON migrations
- ``FormidableItem.value`` field size now has no limit (``TextField``)
- Migrate to PeopleDoc GitHub organization (#283)

Release 1.0.2 (2017-10-10)
==========================

- As of its 3.7 version, it appears that Django REST Framework is no longer compatible with Django 1.8. Added a mention in the README, in the deprecation timeline, and changed tox requirements to reflect this (#272).
- Drop Preset tables (#255).

Release 1.0.1 (2017-10-04)
==========================

- Validation View return the right content-type headers when the validation is okay (#257)
- Fix The error 500 when the formidable object is not found on validation view (#257)
- Fix a 500 error with Mandatory File Fields and conditional display (#263).
- Added tests for the generic exception handler (#263).
- Added Python 3.4/3.3 support deprecation in the Deprecation Timeline documentation (#262).

  - Translation strings have been removed.
  - Swagger documentation updated to reflect this API change.
  - Removed fields that reference preset models in forms and preset args tables through a Django migration (#259).

Release 0.15.0 (2017-08-28)
===========================

- [Doc] New Makefile target to serve the documentation.

.. warning::

    This version is the last one to support Form Presets (form validation rules). The whole software logic and data will be wiped off on the next release. If needed, make backups and try to convert your existing presets to field validation rules. refs #249.

.. warning::

    This version is the last one to support Django Rest Framework 3.3. Please upgrade to the latest available to date (3.6.2). refs #239.
